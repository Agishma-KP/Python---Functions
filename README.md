# Python Functions Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various Python functions, including built-in functions, user-defined functions, and handling of variables (local and global). It covers key concepts such as:
- Using the `len()` function to determine the length of a list.
- Creating functions like `greet(name)` and `find_maximum(numbers)`.
- Differentiating between local and global variables in Python.
- Using default parameter values in functions.

## Files Included
- `functions.py` â†’ Contains all the required Python functions and explanations as comments.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
